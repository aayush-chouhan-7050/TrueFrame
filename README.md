# TrueFrame AI: Deepfake Video Detection Engine

TrueFrame is a full-stack web application designed to detect AI-generated video content, specifically deepfakes. It leverages a state-of-the-art deep learning model (EfficientNet-B0) trained on a large-scale, combined dataset to provide high-accuracy analysis. Users can upload a video through a simple web interface and receive a near-instant verdict on its authenticity, complete with a detailed (simulated) breakdown of analytical markers.



## ✨ Key Features

- **High-Accuracy Detection:** Achieves **~99% accuracy** on its validation set, trained on a diverse dataset combining FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF (v2).
- **Full-Stack Architecture:** Built with a Node.js/Express frontend server and a Python/Flask backend for the AI model, ensuring a scalable and robust system.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean, responsive, and intuitive UI for easy video uploads and clear presentation of results.
- **Dynamic Analysis Reports:** Generates a believable, detailed breakdown of detection markers (e.g., Facial Inconsistencies, Temporal Artifacts) based on the model's confidence.
- **Downloadable PDF Reports:** Users can download a professionally formatted PDF summary of the analysis for their records.

## 🏛️ Project Architecture

The application operates on a two-server model to separate concerns and optimize performance:

1.  **Frontend Server (`frontend/server.js`)**:
    - Built with **Node.js** and **Express**.
    - Serves the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the user.
    - Handles video uploads from the client using `multer`.
    - Acts as a proxy, forwarding the video file to the AI backend for analysis.

2.  **AI Backend Server (`backend/app.py`)**:
    - Built with **Python** and **Flask**.
    - Hosts the pre-trained PyTorch deep learning model (`deepfake_detector_ultimate_model.pth`).
    - Exposes a single API endpoint (`/api/predict`) that accepts a video file.
    - Performs the core analysis: extracts frames, runs inference on each frame, and aggregates the results to produce a final verdict and confidence score.

## 🧠 Model Training & Performance

The core of this project is the deep learning model. The complete training process was conducted on Google Colab to leverage high-performance GPUs.

### Datasets Used

To build a robust model capable of handling real-world videos, a large-scale dataset was created by combining, sampling, and processing two leading academic datasets:

-   **FaceForensics++ (FF++)**: A massive dataset featuring thousands of videos. Its primary contribution was providing a wide **variety** of manipulation types (e.g., Deepfakes, FaceSwap) and a large volume of training examples.
-   **Celeb-DF (v2)**: A newer, more challenging dataset known for its high-quality, realistic deepfakes with fewer obvious artifacts. This dataset was crucial for improving the model's ability to detect **difficult and subtle fakes**.

By training on a combined set of over 3,000 videos from these sources, the model learned a comprehensive range of both low-quality and high-quality forgery patterns.

### Model Performance

The final model was fine-tuned for 10 epochs, achieving a **final validation accuracy of 99.2%**. The detailed performance is visualized in the confusion matrix below, which shows an extremely low error rate for both 'real' and 'fake' classes.

## 🔗 Download Pre-trained Models

The trained model weights are **not included in this repository** to keep the repo lightweight.  
Please download them separately and place them in the `backend/` directory.

### Steps:
1. Download the pre-trained models from here:  
   👉 [Download Models](https://github.com/aayush-chouhan-7050/TrueFrame/releases/download/v1.0.0/TrueFrame-Models-v1.0.zip)

2. Place the downloaded `.pth` files inside the `backend/` folder: 
```
TrueFrame/
├── backend/
│ ├── deepfake_detector_best_model.pth
│ ├── deepfake_detector_model.pth
│ └── deepfake_detector_ultimate_model.pth

```
3. Ensure that `deepfake_detector_ultimate_model.pth` is present before running the backend server.

📌 **Note**:  
- Use `deepfake_detector_ultimate_model.pth` for final deployment.  
- The other `.pth` files are intermediate checkpoints useful for experiments.
